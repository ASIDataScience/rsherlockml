# rsherlock

This package could have a bunch of sherlock utilities in it. Right now, it has the report `Rmd` template and output format.

### Usage

Create a new R-markdown report by going to:

New file -> R Markdown -> from Template -> SherlockML report

Or simply put `output: rsherlock::report` in the yaml front matter of your Rmd file.
